# SlackBook
A service that allows users to chat in Slack through Facebook Messenger

# Usage
After installing app for your Slack team, go to the SlackBook facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/SlackBook-505251276490628) and click the Send Message link.
Then, enter the following messages to start receiving messages from a team:
1. Type "/signin", follow the link, and authorize the app to access your slack account.
2. Type "/subscribe" and follow the prompts to subscribe to messages from a channel.
3. To post to a channel, type "/select" and follow the prompts to select a team and channel (subscribing to a channel automatically selects that channel for you), then type the message you want to send to the channel. Additionally, you can use the syntax "\<Team Name\>:\<Channel Name\> \<Message\>" to select a channel and post to it in one message (Note: you must be subscribed to a channel to post to it).
